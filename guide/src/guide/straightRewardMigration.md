# Migrating from the Straight Reward add-on

To migrate from the [Straight Reward](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/957961234)
add-on, install the [AnkiSRSKai: Straight Reward to Ease
Reward](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/501472260) add-on.

1. In Anki, click on the **Tools** button in the toolbar.
2. Click on the **Add-ons** button.
3. Click on the **Get Add-ons...** button.
4. Input `501472260` in the **Code:** textbox.
5. Click on the **OK** button.
6. Close the **Add-ons** window.
7. Click on the **Tools** button in the toolbar.
8. Click on the **AnkiSrsKai: Update cards with consecutive successful review
   counts** button.

Every card in your collection should now be updated with the correct streak
counts. This can be verified by opening the **Card Browser** by clicking on
**Browse**, right clicking on a card, clicking **Info...**, and confirming that
the **Custom Data** with the **c** key has the correct value based on the card's
review history.

The Straight Reward to Anki SRS Kai add-on can now be **uninstalled** since the
custom scheduler can keep track of your streak without the use of an add-on.
