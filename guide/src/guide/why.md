# Why?

For most users, [FSRS](https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#fsrs) is
**recommended** over the default SM-2 algorithm as it simplifies and reduces the
amount of configurable parameters, and can adapt very well to a user's review
history. Anki SRS Kai aims to fill a niche for power users who wish to stick
with Anki SM-2, but also benefit from the adaptive scheduling algorithm from
FSRS.

Some examples for using Anki SRS Kai include:

1. Convert optimized FSRS parameters to SM-2 parameters for more efficient
   scheduling than the default SM-2 algorithm and use Ease Reward to deal with
   Ease Hell.
2. Implement your own scheduling algorithm based on Anki SM-2.
3. Replace the [Straight Reward](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/957961234)
   addon with Ease Reward which allows users to review on mobile without ever
   needing to sync on PC.
4. Disable fuzz in the Anki SM-2 algorithm.
