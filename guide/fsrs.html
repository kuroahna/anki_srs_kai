<p>The new <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#fsrs">Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler
(FSRS)</a> algorithm introduced in
Anki 23.10 also solves the <a href="issuesWithAnkiSM2.html">issues with Anki-SM2</a> and
makes it simpler to configure by exposing the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#desired-retention">Desired
Retention</a> setting
instead of modifying SM-2 settings such as <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#graduating-interval">Graduating
interval</a>, <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#easy-bonus">Easy
bonus</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, the default FSRS-6 parameters are also better than SM-2 for 99.5%
of users according to the
<a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/srs-benchmark/blob/45f61b2182c27da83839383ec3b044fa5ae27b47/README.md">benchmarks</a>,
which is benchmarked on approximately 10,000 Anki users.</p>
<p>However, some users are reluctant to make the switch because they would still
like full control of the SM-2 scheduling algorithm compared to the <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Algorithm/e6ded59fa6d1d6bb2950a759d53b14575e9e586c">FSRS
algorithm</a>
where the desired retention setting is the main configurable parameter, and
directly modifying the FSRS parameters is generally not advisible since it has
already been optimized to the user's review history.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#learning-and-relearning-steps">FSRS Learning and Relearning Steps
docs</a>,
(re)learning steps should not be greater than or equal to 1 day because</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Re)learning steps of 1 day or greater are not recommended when using FSRS.
The main reason they were popular with the legacy SM-2 algorithm is because
repeatedly failing a card after it has graduated from the learning phase could
reduce its ease a lot, leading to what some people called "ease hell". This is
not a problem that FSRS suffers from. By keeping your learning steps under a
day, you will allow FSRS to schedule cards at times it has calculated are
optimal for your material and memory. Another reason not to use longer
learning steps is because <strong>FSRS may end up scheduling the first review for a
shorter time than your last learning step, leading to the Hard button showing
a longer time than Good.</strong></p>
<p>We also recommend you keep the number of learning steps to a minimum. Evidence
shows that repeating a card multiple times in a single day does not
significantly contribute to long-term memory, so your time is better spent on
other cards or a shorter study session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, some users still wish to have (re)learning steps greater than or
equal to 1 day and hence stick with the default Anki SM-2 algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="ease-hell"><a class="header" href="#ease-hell">Ease Hell</a></h2>
<p>FSRS-6 addresses Ease Hell (ie, Difficulty Hell) by applying <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Algorithm/e6ded59fa6d1d6bb2950a759d53b14575e9e586c">mean
reversion</a>
to the new difficulty value after review. This implies that a card's difficulty
would converge to the average difficulty over time.</p>
<p>However, it is possible that even with optimized parameters, it may take
<strong>thousands</strong> of reviews before a card converges back to the average difficulty.</p>
<p>In particular, the next difficulty value after review with mean reversion
applied is calculated as</p>
<p>\[
D'' = w_7 \cdot D_0(4) + (1 - w_7) \cdot D'
\]</p>
<p>The target value of the mean reversion is \(D_0(4)\), which is the initial
difficulty when the first rating is Easy, and is calculated as</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align}
D_0(G) &amp;= w_4 - e^{w_5 \cdot (G - 1)} + 1 \\
D_0(4) &amp;= w_4 - e^{w_5 \cdot (4 - 1)} + 1 \\
&amp;= w_4 - e^{w_5 \cdot 3} + 1
\end{align}
\]</p>
<p>The next difficulty value after review is calculated as</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align}
\Delta D(G) &amp;= -w_6 \cdot (G - 3) \\
D'          &amp;= D + \Delta D \cdot \frac{10 - D}{9}
\end{align}
\]</p>
<p>And the default parameters for FSRS-6 is</p>
<pre><code>w = [0.212, 1.2931, 2.3065, 8.2956, 6.4133, 0.8334, 3.0194, 0.001, 1.8722,

0.0658, 0.1542]
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose we have an extremely difficult card where \(D = 10\), and we always
press the Good button where \(G = 3\). Then for the first review, we have</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align}
D'' &amp;= w_7 \cdot D_0(4) + (1 - w_7) \cdot D' \\
&amp;= w_7 \cdot D_0(4) + (1 - w_7) \cdot \left( D + \Delta D \cdot \frac{10 - D}{9} \right) \\
&amp;= w_7 \cdot D_0(4) + (1 - w_7) \cdot \left( D + (-w_6 \cdot (G - 3)) \cdot \frac{10 - D}{9} \right) \\
&amp;= w_7 \cdot D_0(4) + (1 - w_7) \cdot \left( 10 + (-w_6 \cdot (3 - 3)) \cdot \frac{10 - 10}{9} \right) \\
&amp;= w_7 \cdot D_0(4) + (1 - w_7) \cdot (10 + (-w_6 \cdot 0) \cdot 0) \\
&amp;= w_7 \cdot D_0(4) + (1 - w_7) \cdot 10 \\
&amp;= w_7 \cdot (w_4 - e^{w_5 \cdot 3} + 1) + (1 - w_7) \cdot 10 \\
&amp;= w_7 \cdot (6.4133 - e^{0.8334 \cdot 3} + 1) + (1 - w_7) \cdot 10 \\
&amp;= w_7 \cdot −4.771630703 + (1 - w_7) \cdot 10 \\
&amp;= 0.001 \cdot −4.771630703 + (1 - 0.001) \cdot 10 \\
&amp;= 0.001 \cdot −4.771630703 + 0.999 \cdot 10 \\
&amp;= −0.004771631 + 9.99 \\
&amp;= 9.985228369 \\
\end{align}
\]</p>

<p>This scenario is not limited to pressing the Again button 2 times in a row. It
is possible to enter Difficulty Hell with the Again -&gt; Good -&gt; Again -&gt; Good
loop. If \(w_7\) is close to 0, it will take many reviews pressing the Good
button before the card exits Difficulty Hell.</p>
<p>Whether the mean reversion in FSRS or the Straight Rewards addon for SM-2 is
actually effective is still under research, but given that FSRS-6 is optimized
on the review history of 10,000 users and found that \(w_7\) to be near
\(0\) seems to indicate that it is not as effective as one may hope. However,
with Straight Rewards, it is possible for a card to exit Ease Hell (Difficulty
Hell) much quicker with user defined values.</p>
<p>Additionally, for some users, after optimizing their deck with optimal
parameters, \( w_7 \) may be 0 or close to 0, making the mean reversion
algorithm virtually nonexistent. Also, manually modifying this value for most
users is generally not recommended, since the parameters have been specifically
chosen for optimal results. Moreover, it goes against the design and simplicity
of the FSRS algorithm. Ideally, the only parameter the user should configure is
the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#desired-retention">Desired
Retention</a>
setting.</p>
<p>Using the Easy button more often can fix this issue, but deciding whether to
press the Easy button to decrease the difficulty or not introduces extra mental
fatigue while reviewing. Additionally, the difficulty of a card is not shown
during reviews. Moreover, some users only use the Again and Good buttons (ie,
Pass/Fail) to reduce mental fatigue. In this case, the difficulty of a card
will require many reviews pressing the Good button before it exits Difficulty
Hell if \(w_7\) is close to 0.</p>
<p>You can determine if your deck is stuck in Difficulty Hell by navigating to the
<strong>Statistics</strong> screen, scrolling down to the <strong>Card Difficulty</strong> graph, and
seeing if your \(w_7\) parameter is close to 0. The image below is an example
of a deck stuck in Difficulty Hell where most of the cards are stuck at 100%
difficulty, and the user's \(w_7\) parameter is \(0.0010\) which means a
card will take a long time to exit difficulty hell.</p>

<h2 id="short-intervals-for-new-cards"><a class="header" href="#short-intervals-for-new-cards">Short intervals for new cards</a></h2>
<p>FSRS-6 addresses the short intervals for new cards issue by optimizing on a
user's collection and determining the best initial stability (interval when
retrievability is 90%) for each rating (Again, Hard, Good, and Easy). That is,
the initial stability after the first rating is calculated as</p>
<p>\[
S_0(G) = w_{G - 1}
\]</p>
<p>where \(G = 1\) is pressing the Again button, \(G = 2\) is pressing the Hard
button, \(G = 3\) is pressing the Good button, and \(G = 4\) is pressing the
Easy button.</p>
<p>With the default parameters,</p>
<pre><code>w = [0.212, 1.2931, 2.3065, 8.2956, 6.4133, 0.8334, 3.0194, 0.001, 1.8722,
0.1666, 0.796, 1.4835, 0.0614, 0.2629, 1.6483, 0.6014, 1.8729, 0.5425, 0.0912,
0.0658, 0.1542]
</code></pre>
<p>we have</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align}
S_0(1) &amp;= 0.212 \\
S_0(2) &amp;= 1.2931 \\
S_0(3) &amp;= 2.3065 \\
S_0(4) &amp;= 8.2956 \\
\end{align}
\]</p>
<p>This implies that the first rating that is chosen for the first learning step
will determine the card's interval when it graduates to a review card.</p>
<p>For example, for a deck with learning steps <code>1m 10m</code> and the first rating is
Good on the first learning step of <code>1m</code>, then when the card has graduated, it
will have an interval of 2 days (rounded down from 2.3065).</p>
<p>There is no direct equivalent in Anki SM-2 for this behaviour, but the closest
is the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#graduating-interval">Graduating
interval</a> and
<a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#easy-interval">Easy interval</a>.</p>
<h2 id="long-intervals-for-mature-cards"><a class="header" href="#long-intervals-for-mature-cards">Long intervals for mature cards</a></h2>
<p>FSRS-6 addresses the long intervals for mature cards issue with the following
formula</p>
<p>\[
S^\prime_r(D,S,R,G) = S \cdot (e^{w_8} \cdot (11-D) \cdot S^{-w_9} \cdot (e^{w_{10}\cdot(1-R)}-1) \cdot w_{15}(\textrm{if G = 2}) \cdot w_{16}(\textrm{if G = 4}) + 1)
\]</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Algorithm/e6ded59fa6d1d6bb2950a759d53b14575e9e586c">FSRS algorithm
wiki</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let \(SInc\) (the increase in stability) denotes \(\frac{S^{'}_{r}(D, S,
R, G)}{S}\) which is equivalent to Anki's ease factor.</p>
<ol>
<li>The larger the value of D , the smaller the \(SInc\) value. This means
that the increase in memory stability for difficult material is smaller
than for easy material.</li>
<li>The larger the value of S , the smaller the \(SInc\) value. This
means that <strong>the higher the stability of the memory, the harder it becomes
to make the memory even more stable.</strong></li>
<li>The smaller the value of R, the larger the \(SInc\) value. This means
that the spacing effect accumulates over time.</li>
<li>The value of \(SInc\) is always greater than or equal to 1 if the review
was
successful.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the formula above is a more sophisticated algorithm than SM-2 for
handling cards that are past its due date or reviewed early. In particular, the
retrievability of a card is calculated as</p>
<p>\[
R(t, S) = \left( 1 + factor \cdot \frac{t}{S} \right)^{-w_{20}}
\]</p>
<p>where \(t\) is the number of days since the last review, \(S\) is the
stability (interval when probability of recall is 90%), and
\(factor = 0.9^{-\frac{1}{w_{20}}} - 1\).</p>
<p>In other words, FSRS can accurately predict the retrievability of a card when it
is reviewed, whether it is early or late. In contrast, Anki SM-2 does not
predict the retrievability of a card. When a card is reviewed past its due date,
the formula becomes</p>
<p>\[
\text{NewInterval} = \left(\text{OldInterval} + \frac{DaysLate}{2}\right) \times
\text{EaseFactor} \times \text{IntervalModifier}
\]</p>
<p>The formula for reviewing a card early in Anki SM-2 is also similar and is
omitted.</p>
<h2 id="post-lapse-stability"><a class="header" href="#post-lapse-stability">Post-lapse stability</a></h2>
<p>When a card is forgotten and relearned, FSRS will retain a portion of the
current interval. The formula is calculated by</p>
<p>\[
S'_{f}(D,S,R) = w_{11} \cdot D^{-w_{12}} \cdot ((S+1)^{w_{13}} - 1) \cdot
e^{w_{14} \cdot (1 - R)}
\]</p>
<p>For example, if a card has an interval of \(S = 1000\) days with \( D = 5 \)
and \( R = 0.9 \) and default FSRS-6 parameters \(w = [ \cdots, 1.4835, 0.0614, 0.2629, 1.6483, \cdots ]\), then</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align}
S'_{f}(5,1000,0.9) &amp;= 1.4835 \cdot 5^{-0.0614} \cdot ((1000+1)^{0.2629} - 1) \cdot
e^{1.6483 \cdot (1 - 0.9)} \\
&amp;\approx 8.16
\end{align}
\]</p>
<p>Forgetting and relearning a card will preserve part of the card's interval.
While preserving a card's interval might make sense since the material has not
been completely forgotten, SuperMemo has found that it is
<a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Post-lapse_stability">harmful</a>, since it slows down
the identification of leeches. They state</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Post-lapse stability (PLS) is the stability after a review with a failing
grade. Unlike stability computed after a successful repetition, post-lapse
stability cannot be derived from the SInc matrix.</p>
<p>In the ideal case, for simple memories, forgetting results in a reset of
estimated stability back to near-zero. In theory, only difficult items made of
composite memories may show a substantial decrease in the costs of
re-learning, however, even that does not show in data.</p>
<p>It has been shown long ago that the length of the first post-lapse optimum
interval is best correlated with the number of memory lapses recorded for the
item. Even then, <strong>post-lapse interval usually oscillates in the range of 1-4
days for the default forgetting index of 10%</strong>. The correlation between lapses
and the PLS is not very useful in adding to the efficiency of learning. Some
competitive spaced repetition software, as well as SuperMemo in its first
years, experimented with re-learning hypotheses based on ancient wisdoms of
psychology, e.g. by halving intervals after a memory lapse. <strong>Current data
shows clearly that this approach is harmful, as it slows down the
identification of leeches.</strong> Such an approach to handling forgotten items is a
form of irrational procrastination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Anki, the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#new-interval">New
Interval</a> setting is
similar and can be used to preserve part of the card's interval, but they also
recommend to leave it at 0.00 for the same reasons above.</p>
<p>For some users, preserving the card's interval may not be desirable but is
likely to not know that this behaviour exists without looking into understanding
how the algorithm works. While one can set \( w_{11} = 0 \) to turn this
behaviour off, this is generally not recommended for the same reasons above in
the <a href="#ease-hell">Ease Hell</a> section</p>
<p>The SuperMemo and <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/srs-benchmark/blob/45f61b2182c27da83839383ec3b044fa5ae27b47/README.md">FSRS
benchmark</a> data
currently conflict as to which is the best approach here, and more research is
most likely required before a conclusion can be drawn.</p>
<h2 id="potential-issues-with-optimizing"><a class="header" href="#potential-issues-with-optimizing">Potential issues with optimizing</a></h2>
<p>While the optimizer can optimize your parameters in order to reach the desired
retention and make the scheduling more efficient and reduce a user's workload,
it can be a double edged sword. Instead of fixing the root cause of the issue,
it may encourage users to continue their bad habits and increase their workload,
losing any efficiency that would have been gained by switching from Anki SM-2 to
FSRS.</p>
<h3 id="poor-encoding-and-card-formulation"><a class="header" href="#poor-encoding-and-card-formulation">Poor encoding and card formulation</a></h3>
<p>If the encoding of the information to be learned and reviewed is poor, then it
will be difficult to recall the information. <a href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">SuperMemo's 20 rules of formulating
knowledge</a> goes into detail on
how to address this and is <strong>highly recommended</strong> to be read in order to use
Anki effectively. Some important points are</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Do not learn if you do not understand</li>
<li>Learn before you memorize</li>
<li>Stick to the minimum information principle</li>
<li>Use imagery</li>
<li>Use mnemonic techniques</li>
<li>Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion</li>
<li>Combat interference</li>
<li>Optimize wording</li>
<li>Personalize and provide examples</li>
<li>Rely on emotional states</li>
<li>Redundancy does not contradict minimum information principle</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some points have been omitted for brevity but are as equally important.</p>
<p>As a result of poor encoding and card formulation, a card will be extremely
difficult to recall which will consequently lower the retention rate of a user's
deck. If the retention rate is low (for example, below 80%) and the user has a
desired retention of 90%, then the optimized parameters and algorithm will
suggest shorter intervals in order to reach a retention of 90%, without the user
fixing the actual issue that caused the low retention rate in the first place.
In this case, the user's workload has increased due to the suggested shorter
intervals after optimizing their parameters.</p>
<h3 id="accidentally-making-review-cards-more-difficult"><a class="header" href="#accidentally-making-review-cards-more-difficult">Accidentally making review cards more difficult</a></h3>
<p>During review, a user may test themselves and unintentionally make the card
harder than it should.</p>
<p>For example, when reviewing a monolingual Japanese vocabulary card where the
front contains the word to be recalled in kanji, and its reading and Japanese
definition on the back, the user may test themselves by checking if they can
regurgitate the Japanese definition word for word. This is an extremely
difficult task and makes the card harder to review than it should.</p>
<p>In this scenario, to make it easier to review, the user can test themselves by
recalling an image if the word is a concrete noun. The benefit of this is that
less time is spent on the card during review and makes it easier to recall. For
words that are not concrete nouns, recalling the gist of the definition and
being lenient with the grading process makes the card less difficult to review.
Furthermore, converting the vocabulary card into a sentence card can also help
make the card less difficult to review.</p>
<p>This is mainly an extension of the minimum information principle but deserves
special mention. For the same reasons above, if the root cause of the issue is
not fixed, the algorithm will simply optimize and suggest shorter intervals and
increase the workload in order to reach the desired retention, encouraging the
user to continue making the card difficult to review.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-hard-button-incorrectly"><a class="header" href="#using-the-hard-button-incorrectly">Using the hard button incorrectly</a></h3>
<p>According to the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#fsrs">Anki FSRS
docs</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FSRS can adapt to almost any habit, except for one: pressing "Hard" instead of
"Again" when you forget the information. When you press "Hard", FSRS assumes
you have recalled the information correctly (though with hesitation and a lot
of mental effort). <strong>If you press "Hard" when you have failed to recall the
information, all intervals will be unreasonably high.</strong> So, if you have this
habit, please change it and use "Again" when you forget the information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, only the Again button is treated as a fail, and the Hard, Good,
and Easy buttons are treated as a Pass. This means that if the user never
presses Again, their retention rate will be very high (near 99%) and the
optimizer will suggest parameters that gives extremely high intervals upon
review in order to reach the user's configured desired retention.</p>
<p>In this case, the suggested intervals are extremely high which make recalling
the information difficult. This leads to failing the card often and inevitably
increase the workload.</p>
